## ‚ú® Overview

This application provides users with actionable water-saving tips. Users can:

- Enter a topic (e.g., "gardening", "showering") to get a custom tip generated by Google's Gemini AI model (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
- Save the generated tip to a unique text file with a timestamp.
- Generate Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio for the tip, saved as a unique MP3 file with a timestamp.
- Access a separate "Saved Content History" page to view the history of all saved text tips and listen to all generated audio files, sorted newest first.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Local Development

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Python 3.8+ installed.
    - Git installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual repository URL if different
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):

    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up API Key (Secrets):**

    - You need a Google Gemini API key. Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    - Create a directory named `.streamlit` in the project root if it doesn't exist: `mkdir .streamlit`
    - Create a file named `secrets.toml` inside the `.streamlit` directory.
    - Add your API key to `secrets.toml`:
      ```toml
      # .streamlit/secrets.toml
      GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      ```
    - **Important:** The `.streamlit` directory should be added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your secret key.

6.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application should open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. Navigate between the main app and the "Saved Content History" page using the sidebar.
